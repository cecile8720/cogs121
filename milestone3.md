## Updated UI

In terms of changes made to the UI, the home screen did not change much, although the information up top now uses the National Park Services API. There is now a search bar at the bottom of the page. The maps page now displays a map, which has settings that can be toggled with to show different modes, such as satellite and map, with or without labels. The nature-finder now takes on image files that the users will upload. There is a blank display that will show the image that the user has just uploaded. The rest was left as is to focus on implementing the backend, which proved to be challenging.
