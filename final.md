# Final Milestone

### Team College Burnouts

Cecile Pham, Jonathan Wong, Youngmin Kim



## Contributions

Cecile: Made the homepage, the navbar, and the css for most of the pages. Set up firebase, and used the National Park Services API to display information on the home page.

John: Made the demo video, the map feature, the sidebar, the header, and tweaks in css on all the pages. The map feature uses the google maps API and uses the current trip info that is stored on firebase to preload areas on the map.

Youngmin: Did the write ups, and made the trail list page. Tested for bugs in the code. Attempted a feature using the everypixel API but couldn't finish.
