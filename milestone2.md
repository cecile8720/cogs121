## Changes from Milestone 1

Our idea is mostly the same as what we proposed in milestone 1. We made changes to the UI and our nature finder function. We originally had the idea to make the nature finder like Google Lens, but we decided to pivot away from that. Now the user will have to describe what they want to learn more about, by inputting physical features for example, to bring up more information on the organism. The home page was also re-done to show the user's current trip and past trips.

(describe how the UI skeleton is different from the paper prototypes)

The UI is motly the same. We added in an icon in the top right corner for the nature finder function and made changes to the tabs in the homescreen. 'Your Trip' is now 'My Trip', and we added in a section for a map.
