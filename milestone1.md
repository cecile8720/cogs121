## Proposal #1

Our target user population are avid outdoor explorers. This would include people who frequently go to national parks. No one in our group would be considered avid outdoor explorers since we haven’t been to any of the national parks, and we don’t have time to do these kinds of exploring. 
APIs for weather, maps, trails, plants, tress, animals
  - https://www.programmableweb.com/api/route-you
  - https://www.programmableweb.com/api/route-you
  - https://www.programmableweb.com/api/activecom-camping
  - https://www.programmableweb.com/api/active-campground
  - https://www.programmableweb.com/api/inaturalist
  - https://www.programmableweb.com/api/qld-wildlife-data
  - https://www.programmableweb.com/api/phylopic

We wanted to include maps and trails for the national parks. We also wanted to implement a database where an explorer could identify plants, trees, and animals while on their hike. However, we weren’t sure if the national parks would have enough reception for this to be useful, especially for the identification of things feature. 


## Proposal #2

Our target user population are scuba divers. We are not a part of this target user population because we have never scuba dived before. 
APIs:
  - https://www.programmableweb.com/api/world-register-marine-species
  - https://fishbase.ropensci.org/
  - http://www.divesites.com/

There would be a weather forecast, and a marine life forecast to see what kind of marine life is present at the current time of year. We would also add a diving log that includes: coordinates of the dive, diving depth, and marine life seen. Finally, we could also add a pre-dive checklist to help divers make sure they have everything since the equipment needed is extensive. 

## Proposal #3

Our target user population are fishermen. We are not a part of this user population because none of us go fishing. 
APIs: 
  - https://www.programmableweb.com/api/fishwatch
  - https://www.programmableweb.com/api/your-fishing-report
  - https://www.programmableweb.com/api/solunar
  - https://github.com/movebank/movebank-api-doc

There would be a weather forecast and a map of the best locations to go fishing. There would also be reports of the best days and times to go based on the fish pattern. Finally, we could also implement a log of sorts to track the fish captured and information about it. 

## Storyboards

Storyboard 1: Our app will help users discover and select appropriate hiking trails for them to use, ensuring they wont get lost.

Storyboard 2: Our app will help users learn more about the wildlife around them, for both safety and curiosity purposes.
